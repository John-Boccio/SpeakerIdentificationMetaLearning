\begin{abstract}
Speaker identification refers to the task of identifying which speaker is talking from a given set of 
speakers. With the rise of deep learning and data driven approaches to audio processing problems, new approaches can be
taken on this problem which traditionally was performed by trying to find separability between
speakers using hand-engineered feature extractors. The speaker identification problem is a very appropriate problem for meta-learning. 
Meta learning is a machine learning technique in which a model is trained to learn how to learn, allowing it to 
adapt to new tasks quickly using relatively little data. By applying meta-learning to the speaker identification problem, 
a model can be trained to learn how to recognize speakers from a small amount of audio samples from each of the speakers. 
This could be useful in scenarios where the set of possible speakers is not known in advance, or where the speakers may vary over time.
\\
\\
All of the data that was used for this paper comes from the VoxCeleb dataset \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/NagraniCZ17}. VoxCeleb
provides labeled audio data spoken from over 1,000 celebrities. These audio files are then cut into 3 second segments and 
converted into a spectrogram which will then be fed into a convolutional neural network. The final
result is a dataset with over 200,000 spectrograms, each labeled with an id that represents the celebrity that is talking.
\\
\\
The approach that this paper has taken towards applying meta-learning to the speaker identification problem is through the 
use of a prototypical network (protonet) \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/SnellSZ17}. The protonet generates an representation of a
spectrogram from one speaker which, ideally, is a far distance from the representation of a spectrogram from a different
speaker. These representations of each speaker are then used to perform classification. This paper also experiments with 
the affects of pretraining the network using a masked autoencoder \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2111-06377}.
\\
\\
Given 5 different speakers and 15 seconds of utterances from each of them, the model trained from scratch in this paper 
is able to identify who from those 5 speakers is speaking with 91.7\% accuracy. If the model is given 30 seconds of utterances
from each speaker, this accuracy increases to 95.6\%. When the model is initialized with the weights learned from the 
masked autoencoder, the accuracy decreases, implying that MAE's do not find good representations for separating speakers.

\section{Introduction}
The problem that this paper is solving is the problem of speaker identification; given a set of speakers, create an
algorithm to identify which one of those speakers is speaking in an audio clip. This problem has a wide variety of 
applications ranging from security, automatic speech recognition, and forensic analysis. More specifically, this paper focuses
on how to solve the speaker identification problem in a few-shot setting. Few-shot learning is an area of machine learning
which focuses on the ability of a model to learn and generalize from a small number of examples. Many cases arise in applications
where only a small amount of audio recordings from a speaker have been captured. In scenarios like this, having a few-shot
capable model is necessary. This paper explores how well a simple model can perform on the speaker identification problem when only given 3, 15, or
30 seconds of data across 3, 5, or 10 different speakers. The model used is a convolutional neural network that only
consists of convolutional layers, batch normalization layers, max pooling layers, and ReLU activation functions.

To augment few-shot learning, masked autoencoders will be used to perform unsupervised pretraining. By combining MAEs with
few-shot learning techniques, it is possible to create a model that can accurately identify speakers based on a small 
amount of input data. In this paper, we will explore the potential benefits and drawbacks of using few shot learning and
masked autoencoders for speaker identification, as well as the current state of the field and possible future directions
for research.

% Explain the problem and why it is important. Discuss your motivation for pursuing this
% problem. Give some background if necessary. Clearly state what the input and output
% is. Be very explicit: “The input to our algorithm is an {image, amplitude, patient age,
% rainfall measurements, grayscale video, etc.}. We then use a {SVM, neural network, linear
% regression, etc.} to output a predicted {age, stock price, cancer type, music genre, etc.}.”
% This is very important since different teams have different inputs/outputs spanning different
% application domains. Being explicit about this makes it easier for readers. If you are using
% your project for multiple classes, add a paragraph explaining which components of the
% project were used for each class.

\section{Related work}
There are multiple ways to tackle this problem and how you do so can depend on the data that you have available and 
the use case. If all of the speakers that need to be identified are known ahead of time and that set of speakers will 
not change, then a large network could be created to perform the classification. This approach is quite fragile as it 
depends on knowing all the potential speakers ahead of time, having plently of data for each, and restricts you to 
always classifying from your entire speaker set. Another approach is to form i-vectors \cite{ivectors}. An i-vector
is a representation of an utterance that is formed by utilizing a statisical model and speech-to-text. Characteristic 
information about a speaker's voice is contained within these i-vectors which can then be applied to the speaker 
identification task. This approach works well in some scenarios but still falls short as the i-vector may not be optimal
for finding separability between speakers even though it captures the characteristics of a speakers voice well.

The disadvantages of classifying all speakers or using i-vectors can be resolved by using meta-learning. Meta-learning
enables us to selectively choose the amount of speakers we need to distinguish between and the amount of utterances we have
for each. A paper which performs similar experiements to what is done here is "Few-Shot Speaker Identification Using Depthwise
Separable Convolutional Network with Channel Attention" \cite{FewShotSpeakerIDChannelAttention} by Yanxiong Li et al. Li
only performed few-shot learning experiments with many speakers (80) and examples per speakers (200) whereas the 
focus of this paper is to analyze how a simple network can perform on a small number of speakers (3, 5, 10) and examples (1, 5, 10).

Autoencoders were first introduced in the book "Parallel distributed processing: explorations in the microstructure of 
cognition" \cite{ParallelDistributedProcessing}. Masked autoencoders are a derivative of autoencoders in which some of the
input to the autoencoder is hidden and it is the job of the decoder to reconstruct the missing information. Kaiming He's paper
"Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners" \cite{MAE} popularized this unsupervised pretraining algorithm for vision based tasks.
Many ideas from He's paper will be explored in this paper in the context of unsupervised pretraining for speaker identification.
Daisuke Nizzumi's "Masked Modeling Duo: Learning Representations by Encouraging Both Networks to Model 
the Input" \cite{MaskedModelingDuo} explores masked autoencoders and a new unsupervised reconstruction algorithm for finding representations 
of audio data. Their paper challenges MAE by stating that they do not always learn good representations. This may explain 
why this paper has found that using a MAE for unsupervised pretraining does not improve the accuracy on the speaker identification problem.

An excellent survey paper on modern day approaches to the problem of speaker identification is "Speaker Recognition Based on
Deep Learning: An Overview" \cite{SpeakerRecognitionOverview} by Zhongxin Bai and Xiao-Lei Zhang. This paper can serve as
a guide for anyone looking to experiment with different ideas related to this topic.

\section{Dataset and Features}
The dataset used for this paper consists entirely of data from VoxCeleb \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/NagraniCZ17}. The 
VoxCeleb dataset is a collection of over 150,000 utterances from 1,251 celebrities. There is also the VoxCeleb2 \cite{Chung18b} 
dataset, which has even more celebrities and utterances, but VoxCeleb1 provided enough data for the purposes of this paper.
The owners and maintainers of VoxCeleb no longer host a download for all of the audio files of the utterances but the 
links to the youtube videos with labeled timestamps is available. A tool had to be created to scrape the data off of
youtube to reconstruct this dataset. The final result is a few thousand audio files, each of which have associated labeled
timestamps that specify which celebrity was speaking.

\subsection{Audio Preprocessing}
To preprocess the audio data from the VoxCeleb1 dataset, the raw audio data was converted into a melspectrogram. A 
spectrogram is a visual representation of the frequency content of a signal over time, and it can be useful for 
analyzing the characteristics of a speaker's voice. A melspectrogram, on the other hand, represents the audio data in 
terms of mel-frequency bins, which are a nonlinear scale of frequency that is closer to the way the human ear perceives 
sound. One advantage of using a melspectrogram instead of a regular spectrogram is that it can better capture the 
characteristics of the human voice, such as the pitch and timbre. This is because the mel-frequency scale is more closely 
aligned with the way the human ear processes sound, so a melspectrogram can better represent the spectral content of speech signals.

Since all of the utterances are of different lengths, a single length had to be decided on. In this paper, the 
length that was chosen was 3 seconds. If an utterance was greater than 3 seconds, then it was split into multiple 3 
second utterances. Any utterance that was less than 3 seconds was thrown out.

The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was used to convert the 3 seconds of audio data into the melspectrogram. The spectrogram
was created with 256 mels, 2048 point FFTs, a hanning windowing function, and a hop length equivalent to 10 milliseconds. 
All of the audio data was downloaded at a sample rate of 16 kHz, so a 10 millisecond hop length is equivalent to 160 
samples. The audio sampling rate being 16 kHz also implies that the maximum frequency of the spectrogram is 8 kHz which 
is enough to capture most speech sounds.

Once all the utterances are converted into melspectrograms, we arrive at a labeled dataset of over 250,000 images of 
size 256 by 301. An example spectrogram can be seen in figure \ref{fig:SpectrogramExample}. This paper uses the same 
train and test split that is provided by VoxCeleb; 1,211 celebrities are in the training set and 40 celebrities are in 
the test set. The features in the melspectrograms provide the information needed to create models that can perform 
speaker identification.

% \begin{equation}
%   L_{\text{prototypical}} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \text{dist} \left( \boldsymbol{p}_i, f(\boldsymbol{x}_i) \right)
% \end{equation}

% Describe your dataset: how many training/validation/test examples do you have? Is there
% any preprocessing you did? What about normalization or data augmentation? What is the
% resolution of your images? How is your time-series data discretized? Include a citation on
% where you obtained your dataset from. Depending on available space, show some examples
% from your dataset. You should also talk about the features you used. If you extracted
% features using Fourier transforms, word2vec, PCA,
% ICA, etc. make sure to talk about it. Try to include examples of your data in the report
% (e.g. include an image, show a waveform, etc.).

\section{ Methods }
There are two methods used in this paper to achieve few-shot learning on the speaker identification problem. The first
method is to use protonets trained from scratch on the VoxCeleb dataset. The second method is to perform unsupervised
pretraining using a masked autoencoder and then training a protonet for few-shot learning with the weights initialized
to those learned by the masked autoencoder.

\subsection{Prototypical Network}
The data being used to identify speakers is a spectrogram of human speech. This makes makes using a convolutional neural network
a very appealing choice. A spectrogram can be treated as an image and then the CNN can be used to find features within
the spectrogram to identify the speakers. In order to perform few-shot learning with the prototypical network, the problem
needs to be formed in such a way that meta-learning can be applied, as in we want to train the network to learn how to learn
to identify speakers from a few given examples. The paper "Prototypical Networks for Few-shot Learning" \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/SnellSZ17}
outlines the theory on how to do so.

The convolutional neural network itself can be thought of as an encoder. In this paper, we used a simple 6 layer 
convlutional neural network which can be seen in table \ref{tab:CNN}. It takes as input a spectrogram and outputs a
1024-dimensional vector. When various spectrograms of a speaker are inputted into this network, the CNN should produce
similar encodings. This would imply that the encodings store information about the humans voice such as its timbre and 
pitch and not information about a particular utterance. The CNN can be driven to create such encodings by utilizing the
prototypical loss defined in "Prototypical Networks for Few-shot Learning" \cite[]{DBLP:journals/corr/SnellSZ17}.

When performing meta-learning, it is common to refer to the number of classes $N$ and the number of examples of each class
given as $K$, or N-way K-shot learning. When using the prototypical loss, we take our $K$ samples of each class, form the
encoding using the CNN, and average them to create a prototype for each class $\mathbf{c}_k$ as seen in equation \ref{eq:prototype}.
$S_k$ refers to all the examples for class $k$, $\mathbf{x}_i$ is the spectrogram, and $y_i$ is the speaker label.

\begin{equation}
  \mathbf{c}_k = \frac{1}{|S_k|} \sum_{\left(\mathbf{x}_i, y_i\right) \in S_k} f_\phi\left(\mathbf{x}_i\right)
  \label{eq:prototype}
\end{equation}

Once the prototypes $\mathbf{c}_k$ are created, we then classify a new speaker by creating it's encoding 
$f_\phi\left(\mathbf{x}_i\right)$ and finding which prototype $\mathbf{c}_k$ it is closest to using a distance function
$d$. This can be done with a softmax function as shown in equation \ref{eq:prototype_probability}. The network can then 
be optimized by taking negative-log probability of $p_\phi\left(y=k | \mathbf{x}\right)$ and minimizing it. The final
prototypical loss is shown in equation \ref{eq:prototypical_loss}. The number of classes $N$ and number of samples for
each class $K$ can be adjusted based on the specific problem being solved.

\begin{equation}
  p_\phi\left(y=k | \mathbf{x}\right) = \frac{\exp\left(-d\left(f_\phi\left(\mathbf{x}\right), \mathbf{c}_k\right)\right)}{\sum_{k'} \exp\left(-d\left(f_\phi\left(\mathbf{x}\right), \mathbf{c}_{k'}\right)\right) }
  \label{eq:prototype_probability}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  J\left(\phi\right) = - \log \left(p_\phi\left(y=k | \mathbf{x}\right)\right)
  \label{eq:prototypical_loss}
\end{equation}

Each of the $K$ support examples for the $N$ speakers is an image of a spectrogram that consists of a 3 second utterance.
This means that there is $3.0 \cdot K$ seconds of available speech data for each of the speakers and the prototypical
network needs to learn how to identify each speaker with that amount of given data.

\subsection{Unsupervised Pretraining with Masked Autoencoders}
Autoencoders are a popular method for performing unsupervised pretraining. Autoencoders consist of an encoder and decoder
network. The encoder will take in the image of spectrogram, reduce it down to a low dimensional vector, and the decoder
will attempt to reconstruct the original spectrogram with the low dimensional vector as it's input. The idea behind this
is that if the network is able to create a low dimensional representation of the input spectrogram which can be reconstructed
into the original spectrogram with a decoder network, then that low dimensional network should hopefully contain useful 
information about what that input spectrogram had consisted of. In the context of speech processing, this low dimensional 
vector should contain information about the unique characteristics about each of the speakers voice, such as the frequency, 
intensity, and harmonic structure, as that is what is necessary to know to reconstruct the spectrograms.The weights that 
are found for the encoder can then be used to intialize the weights of the protonet which can lead to a higher accuracy 
network or faster convergence. Often, reconstructing the input image is too easy of a task for an autoencoder when the 
entirity of the input image is given. Instead, a portion of the input image, often a majority, will be masked out and it 
is the job of the autoencoder to recreate the masked out portion. This is referred to as a masked autoencoder and is 
outlined in "Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners" \cite{MAE} and is what will be used for pretraining in this paper.

\section{Experiments, Results, \& Discussion}
Experiments were performed on tasks that consisted of classifying utterances from 3, 5, or 10 different speakers. For
each of these tasks, 1, 5, or 10 speech examples were provided to learn from. These examples are also referred to as support set. Each
of the tasks then had 15 additional examples per speaker that were used to test how well we learned from the support 
examples. The loss is then calculated from these 15 additional examples, also known as query set, and the prototypes found from the support set.
The loss function that is used can be seen in equation \ref{eq:prototypical_loss}. The tasks were formed by first randomly selecting $N$ celebrities
from the list of celebrtiies in the dataset. Then for each of the celebrities, $K + 15$ speech utterances, which are in the form
of spectrograms, are randomly chosen to create the support and query sets. These tasks are then batched and used to train
the prototypical network whose architecture is outlined in table \ref{tab:CNN}.

\end{table}

\subsection{Prototypical Network From Scratch}
The first experiments that were performed consisted of training the prototypical network from scratch (no weight initialization
from the masked autoencoder). Every 50 iterations during training, the protonet is tested on a randomly selected set of tasks from the 
test set. The amount of randomly selected test tasks was set to 4x the batch size. The batch size was set to 4 when training
for 3-way and 5-way classification and was set to 2 for 10-way classification. A higher batch size would have been desirable 
but it was chosen to be a value which allowed the network to be trained on the hardware that was available. The Adam optimizer
was used with a learning rate of $0.001$ and was trained on $5,000$ tasks. This optimizer and the training hyperparameters were chosen
through experimentation.

The results of this experiment show that the protonet performed very well at the speaker identification problem. The results
of this experiment are shown in table \ref{tab:ProtonetResults}.
